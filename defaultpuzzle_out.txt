Enter your puzzle, use a zero to represent the blank 

Enter the first row, use spaces between numbers: 1 2 3
Enter the second row, use spaces between numbers: 4 0 6
Enter the third row, use spaces between numbers: 7 5 8


Enter your choice of algorithm

Expanding state: (['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '0', '6'], ['7', '5', '8'])

The best state to expand with a g(n) = 1 and h(n) = 1 is...
(['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '5', '6'], ['7', '0', '8'])	Expanding this node...

Goal!! 

To solve this problem the search algorithm expanded a total of 2 nodes.
The maximum number of nodes in the queue at any one time was 5.
The depth of the goal node was 2
