# CS170-EightPuzzle
Assignmet 1 for CS170: Intro to AI at UCR. We were tasked to create a program that would take a given Eight Puzzle and solve it with A* utilizing one of three possible heuristics: Uniform Cost Search, Misplaced Tiles, and Manhattan Distance.

To run the program please typle in ```python eightpuzzle.py``` which will then allow you to use the GUI interface to insert a puzzle and choose the heuristic.
